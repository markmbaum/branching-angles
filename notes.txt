size of geographic grouping influences correlations significantly, huc4 appears to be sweet spot

potential sections
- conus description, feature importance
- role of the vegetation index
  - can it be understood by looking at high-veg conus and low-veg conus
  - cluster analysis?
- basin scale conus description, geographic sampling at different scales
- how would loss of low order streams bias mars results
- best prediction of Mars climate
  - controlling for vegetation
  - potentially with uncertainty due to stream ordering
  - including by geologic units
